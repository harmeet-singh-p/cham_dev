  <h4>ORDERS</h4>
      <p>Orders may be placed by phone, fax, mail or email. Availability of merchandise and receipt of order should be confirmed verbally with showroom staff. A written purchase order including specific wiring and customization instructions must follow within 7 days along with a 50% deposit to consider an item sold and to begin any necessary custom finishing or wiring. Payment must be made in full before merchandise leaves the premises. 
    </p>

  <h4>PAYMENT </h4>
      <p>Chameleon accepts checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. NYC sales tax will be charged unless valid resale certificates are presented at the time of payment. 
    </p>

  <h4>COMPLETION SCHEDULE </h4>
      <p>Depending on the level of customization required, most orders are completed 2-8 weeks after initial deposit is received and work can commence. Orders for items from our Signature Collection not in stock may take longer. Generally, less customization shortens completion time. Chameleon makes a good faith effort to deliver within this time frame but cannot be held responsible for delays due to circumstances beyond its control (i.e. outsourced plating etc). A rush service is also available at management.s discretion. 

    </p>
    
  <h4>SHIPPING AND CLAIMS </h4>
      <p>All packing, shipping and insurance charges are the buyer.s responsibility with no exceptions. Chameleon does not deliver but can provide a list of messenger services and shippers upon request. Shipping costs vary depending on size, weight and fragility of items purchased. Approximate shipping charge can be quoted at time of purchase. Any damage claims should be made within 3 days of receipt of shipment and will be referred to the shipper. All packing materials should be saved to facilitate insurance claims. Chameleon cannot be held responsible for damage to items once they leave the premises.
    </p>    


  <h4>RETURNS </h4>
      <p>Merchandise in original condition can be returned within 14 days of shipment for store credit less a 20% restocking fee. Merchandise altered due to custom finishes, wiring or physical modifications cannot be returned under any circumstances. Any shipping charges incurred by buyer are non-refundable. 
    </p>    

  <h4>UL WIRING AND CUSTOMIZATION </h4>
      <p>All the items in the Chameleon Signature Collection are UL listed at no extra charge. Items from our Antique Collection are newly wired but not UL listed. Antiques can, however, be UL listed at a charge of $75.00 per socket plus, at the discretion of management, a charge for physical modifications made to fixtures to comply with UL requirements (i.e. back plate installations on antique sconces etc). All UL wiring requests should be cleared verbally with showroom technicians at the time of order placement and be included in writing on the purchase order. Any physical modifications made to antique fixtures due to UL requests make them ineligible for return. 
    </p>    
    
      <p>Ceiling drop distance for hanging fixtures is generally adjustable but measurements must be included on purchase order and be cleared verbally with showroom technicians. Chameleon offers standard metal finishes (click on <a href="chameleon-finishes.aspx">FINISHES</a>) but can provide custom finishes on request. 
    </p>       

  <h4>STORAGE </h4>
      <p>Due to insurance and space constraints, Chameleon cannot store merchandise on the premises for more than 2 weeks after work completion and client notification. Thereafter storage charges will accrue at management's discretion. Chameleon cannot be held responsible for damage to merchandise left on the premises beyond that period of time.
