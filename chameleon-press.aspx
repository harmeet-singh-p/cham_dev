      <p>At Chameleon we take our commitment to the environment seriously. We work with recycled brass and packing materials including biodegradable peanuts. The plating facilities we use are U.S. EPA and OSHA compliant and endorse the application of Zero Discharge Recovery plating systems which recycle water and don’t release toxins into the sewer system and ultimately into the drinking table. We have a wide assortment of fixtures that beautifully accommodate Compact Fluorescent (CFL) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamping for your energy efficient goals. We believe style and energy efficiency can go hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    But our greatest contribution to the green initiative is our commitment to manufacturing a quality product. The concept of planned obsolescence inherent in most consumer products, in aggregate and over the course of time, is a significant contributor to global emissions. We choose to protect the environment by manufacturing quality products that stand the test of time enough that one day, they themselves will be considered desirable antiques. When compared to consumer grade fixtures that require multiple replacements over time, a quality product, by virtue of its timelessness, naturally has a much smaller impact on the environment; it’s only manufactured once and consumes only that finite amount of raw materials, power and resources required for its production. And by extension, acquiring fixtures that are currently antiques impacts the environment even less. They are the ultimate in green since they already exist and considering they have already stood the test of time, if properly cared for they will certainly be around for another era and will never have to be remanufactured. By providing you quality new fixtures and well preserved antique fixtures, we can all significantly reduce our impact on the environment and enjoy beautiful surroundings at the same time. It’s a win-win for everyone and Chameleon is proud to be a part of it.
