                            Since 1993 we at Chameleon Fine Lighting have travelled the globe collecting the 
                    rarest and finest examples of 19th and 20th century American and European 
                    lighting. From grand Georgian-style 
                    chandeliers to high deco wall sconces to mid-century modern Italian blown glass 
                    lamps, we’ve more than just traded in them…we’ve come to understand them, to 
                    appreciate their subtle nuances, to truly live them.  And we’ve always felt it’s only 
                    through the handling and appreciation of great
                    antique lighting that you can create 
                    great  lighting.  So it’s in this spirit that we 
                    created a unique line of exciting, superbly crafted, hand-finished residential 
                    and commercial lighting…our Signature Line.

                    <p>
                        The key to the Signature Line’s broad appeal in the design community is 
                    that it takes styles steeped in tradition both classical and modern and gives 
                    them a bold fresh new twist.  And 
                    the attention paid to quality, precision in manufacturing and customer service 
                    is second to none. And we are proud to say this commitment to quality hasn’t 
                    gone unnoticed.  Our line is now 
                    represented in design showrooms in most major markets around the country and in 
                    Canada.  We’ve also expanded our 
                    Custom and Hospitality divisions completing often times complex custom lighting 
                    projects large and small for prominent residential designers as well as major 
                    hospitality firms including hotels and restaurants.

                        Owners John Harvey and Robert Nesle Degiarde began their journey almost 20 years 
                    ago in a small downtown NYC storefront on Lafayette Street in Soho where 
                    Chameleon became known to the design trade for fine antique chandeliers, wall 
                    lights and table lamps in myriad styles to suit or adapt to any 
                    environment...hence the company name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The business partners furthered their training in lighting excellence under the 
                    tutelage of Albert Nesle, Degiarde's grandfather and founder of the famed 
                    chandelier showroom on E. 57th Street in NYC which bears his name. That training 
                    took the form of auction viewings, estate sales and buying trips with Nesle 
                    around the country and around the world to countries as far as India in their 
                    hunt for important English and European lighting. Due in no small part to his 
                    guidance, Chameleon has also collected some of the finest examples of American 
                    lighting by such esteemed companies as E.F. Caldwell of NY, where Nesle actually 
                    worked early in his career.

                        Upon the company's move to East 59th Street, the heart of the design 
                    district and across from the D &amp; D building in 2002, Chameleon began evolving 
                    into its present form. The Signature Line became much more prominent, and has 
                    continued to evolve in range and depth, presenting a wide palate of both styles 
                    and materials. As Harvey and Degiarde both started with antiques as their 
                    reference points for quality, they have brought this awareness into the 
                    Signature Line, insuring high standards of craftsmanship are met. Although much 
                    emphasis has been placed on the Signature pieces as well as custom work, 
                    Chameleon has still maintained its prominence in having some of the finest 
                    antique lighting to be found in any showroom in the world.
