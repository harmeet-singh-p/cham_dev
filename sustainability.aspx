                            At Chameleon we take our commitment to the environment seriously. We work with 
                            recycled brass and packing materials including biodegradable peanuts. The 
                            plating facilities we use are U.S. EPA and OSHA compliant and endorse the 
                            application of Zero Discharge Recovery plating systems which recycle water and 
                            don’t release toxins into the sewer system and ultimately into the drinking 
                            table. We have a wide assortment of fixtures that beautifully accommodate 
                            Compact Fluorescent (CFL) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamping for your energy 
                            efficient goals. We believe style and energy efficiency can go hand in hand.<br />
                            <br />
                            But our greatest contribution to the green initiative is our commitment to 
                            manufacturing a quality product. The concept of planned obsolescence inherent in 
                            most consumer products, in aggregate and over the course of time, is a 
                            significant contributor to global emissions. We choose to protect the 
                            environment by manufacturing quality products that stand the test of time enough 
                            that one day, they themselves will be considered desirable antiques. When 
                            compared to consumer grade fixtures that require multiple replacements over 
                            time, a quality product, by virtue of its timelessness, naturally has a much 
                            smaller impact on the environment; it’s only manufactured once and consumes only 
                            that finite amount of raw materials, power and resources required for its 
                            production. And by extension, acquiring fixtures that are currently antiques 
                            impacts the environment even less. They are the ultimate in green since they 
                            already exist and considering they have already stood the test of time, if 
                            properly cared for they will certainly be around for another era and will never 
                            have to be remanufactured. By providing you quality new fixtures and well 
                            preserved antique fixtures, we can all significantly reduce our impact on the 
                            environment and enjoy beautiful surroundings at the same time. It’s a win-win 
                            for everyone and Chameleon is proud to be a part of it.
