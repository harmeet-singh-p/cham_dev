                Designed with the busy decorator in mind but available to everyone, MY WORKSHOP 
                is your own private work space on our site which you can access any time and 
                from any computer with an internet connection. MY WORKSHOP allows you to save 
                and organize items as you browse so you can quickly access them next time you 
                visit and gives you tools to email those items to your clients quickly and 
                efficiently. It also allows you to save your own custom searches.
                <br />
                <br />
                In MY WORKSHOP you create and name folders called &quot;PORTFOLIOs&quot;...one for every 
                client/project you&#39;re working on. On the MY WORKSHOP page just click the &quot;Create 
                New Portfolio&quot; link, enter the portfolio name and click &quot;Save&quot;. As you browse 
                you simply save the items you&#39;re interested in to the appropriate PORTFOLIO by 
                clicking the &quot;Save item to Portfolio&quot; link underneath the thumbnail. You can 
                track as many items as you want in as many PORTFOLIOs as you need. You can also 
                attach a note to the individual items...for example, you can create a client 
                PORTFOLIO named &quot;Mrs. Jones&quot; and save a chandelier item to it noted &quot;Dining 
                Room&quot;.
                <br />
                <br />
                Within MY WORKSHOP you can also email items directly to clients without having 
                to use your own email and thereby avoiding the hassle of attaching and sending 
                the file or weblink...we do the work for you! You can email items individually 
                when you click on the thumbnail and display the details page or you can send the 
                entire PORTFOLIO so your client can see, in a neat and organized fashion, the 
                progress you’ve made on their particular project. The recipient can then view 
                and print any item you&#39;ve sent them.
                <br />
                <br />
                MY WORKSHOP also allows you to create your own individual SAVED SEARCHES so you 
                can return to perform the same search over and over again. Just click the 
                &quot;Create New Search&quot; link in MY WORKSHOP or create and execute an ADVANCED 
                SEARCH, name it and click the &quot;Save Search&quot; link on the left side of the page. 
                Our inventory changes daily so if you’re looking for something specific and we 
                don’t have it this week, check again next week using the same SAVED SEARCH and 
                you may just find it!</font></td>
