                        ORDERS<br /><br />
                Orders may be placed by phone, fax, mail or email. Availability of merchandise 
                and receipt of order should be confirmed verbally with showroom staff. A written 
                purchase order including specific wiring and customization instructions must 
                follow within 7 days along with a 50% deposit to consider an item sold and to 
                begin any necessary custom finishing or wiring. Payment must be made in full 
                before merchandise leaves the premises.
                <br />
                <br />
                PAYMENT
                <br />
                Chameleon accepts checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. NYC 
                sales tax will be charged unless valid resale certificates are presented at the 
                time of payment.
                <br />
                <br />
                COMPLETION SCHEDULE<br />
                Depending on the level of customization required, most orders are completed 2-8 
                weeks after initial deposit is received and work can commence. Orders for items 
                from our Signature Collection not in stock may take longer. Generally, less 
                customization shortens completion time. Chameleon makes a good faith effort to 
                deliver within this time frame but cannot be held responsible for delays due to 
                circumstances beyond its control (i.e. outsourced plating etc). A rush service 
                is also available at management.s discretion.
                <br />
                <br />
                SHIPPING AND CLAIMS<br />
                All packing, shipping and insurance charges are the buyer.s responsibility with 
                no exceptions. Chameleon does not deliver but can provide a list of messenger 
                services and shippers upon request. Shipping costs vary depending on size, 
                weight and fragility of items purchased. Approximate shipping charge can be 
                quoted at time of purchase. Any damage claims should be made within 3 days of 
                receipt of shipment and will be referred to the shipper. All packing materials 
                should be saved to facilitate insurance claims. Chameleon cannot be held 
                responsible for damage to items once they leave the premises.
                <br />
                <br />
                RETURNS<br />
                Merchandise in original condition can be returned within 14 days of shipment for 
                store credit less a 20% restocking fee. Merchandise altered due to custom 
                finishes, wiring or physical modifications cannot be returned under any 
                circumstances. Any shipping charges incurred by buyer are non-refundable.
                <br />
                <br />
                UL WIRING AND CUSTOMIZATION<br />
                All the items in the Chameleon Signature Collection are UL listed at no extra 
                charge. Items from our Antique Collection are newly wired but not UL listed. 
                Antiques can, however, be UL listed at a charge of $75.00 per socket plus, at 
                the discretion of management, a charge for physical modifications made to 
                fixtures to comply with UL requirements (i.e. back plate installations on 
                antique sconces etc). All UL wiring requests should be cleared verbally with 
                showroom technicians at the time of order placement and be included in writing 
                on the purchase order. Any physical modifications made to antique fixtures due 
                to UL requests make them ineligible for return.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ceiling drop distance for hanging fixtures is generally adjustable but 
                measurements must be included on purchase order and be cleared verbally with 
                showroom technicians. Chameleon offers standard metal finishes (click on

                    href="chameleon-finishes.aspx" target="_blank">

                <br />
                <br />
                STORAGE<br />
                Due to insurance and space constraints, Chameleon cannot store merchandise on 
                the premises for more than 2 weeks after work completion and client 
                notification. Thereafter storage charges will accrue at management&#39;s discretion. 
                Chameleon cannot be held responsible for damage to merchandise left on the 
                premises beyond that period of time.
